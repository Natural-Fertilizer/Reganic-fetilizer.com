  <p>All organic fertilizers are not created equal. Before buying and applying, learn which products act fast,<br> which offer season-long feeding, and which will offer benefits other than nutrient delivery.<br> Some fertilizers can even influence soil structure. So buy what is useful and effective for you soil that doesn't contain <br> any harmful chemicals with reasonable price and Organic fertilizers are naturally available mineral sources that contain moderate <br>amount of plant essential nutrients. They are capable of mitigating problems associated with synthetic fertilizers.<br> They reduce the necessity of repeated application of synthetic fertilizers to maintain soil fertility.
    rganic materials and fertilizers improve<br> the soil texture, allowing it to hold water longer, and increase the bacterial and fungal activity in the soil. <br> So, they not only assist your plants, they help the soil. Synthetic fertilizers, on the other hand, deplete the soil of its nutrients, making it unproductive.<br> Good luck growing those juicy tomatoes in unproductive soil!</p>
